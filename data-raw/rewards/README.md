# Rewards raw data

These files contain the rewards received for each battle fought. To start a new
day, open a csv file from a previous day in Excel, save it as the current day 
using the rYYYYMMDD.csv format, and start entering data at the bottom. 
At the end of the day, delete the rows corresponding to the previous day's data.
This process helps because Excel provides suggestions and auto-completes entries
thus reducing typos.

For each reward received, enter the battleID (which you obtain from the 
associated battles raw data), the item name, and the number received from that
attempt at the battle.
