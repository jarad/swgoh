# Battles raw data

These files contain the battles fought. To start a new
day, open a csv file from a previous day in Excel, save it as the current day 
using the bYYYYMMDD.csv format, remove all content except the header and the
first column (which is sequential integers starting at 1).

For each battle fought, in the next available line enter the userID, the battle
name, and the number of times the battle was simulated. If the battle was not
simulated, put in a 0.
