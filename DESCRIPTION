Description: The package contains counts for battle rewards from the mobile 
    game Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. The intent of these data are to provide a
    modern data set for the analysis of count and the estimation of 
    probabilities related to the binomial, Poisson, and multinomial distributions.
    Hierarchical extensions of these models could be used to borrow information 
    among similar reward types.
    It may also be possible to utilize change-point models
    to identify when the probabilities or rates have changed.
